The whole system is open source, and (if you're brave!) you can run it yourself: https://github.com/penrose/penrose

#### DL architectures

[Taco Cohen](https://twitter.com/TacoCohen/status/1480855159236440066)

The first law of DL architectures:   "Whatever" is all you need. Any problem that can be solved by transformer / ViT can be solved by MLP / CNN, and vice versa (provided you do exhaustive tuning, and use the right inductive bias).  

Like [A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545)
